TODO:
- Bounds checking lol
- Multiple players and enemies (might just work?)
- Movement code for enemies (all of them will use the same pathfinding, just travel directly towards
nearest party member within movement range)
- Implement movement range checking in general
- Items 
- Magic
- Basic stat displays (likely just health and timer values, or large stat dumps idk)
- Interface system (miiiiiiiight make everything a class???)
    - Bare minimum requires modularization and redefinition of all text based code
- Level system and stat growth
- Item rarity
- Enemy rarity? (may just be the level)
- Expand content
